How to Practice Martial Arts, according to an unnamed master (to protect his identity)

by Adrian Jewell, 2020

The following is an explanation of how to defend oneself against those who are bigger and stronger than oneself. In learning such a skill, Sifu often reminds us that “training isn’t about learning how to fight, it’s about learning how to move.” That is, fighting is scary, while movement is something we can learn. Therefore, train the body to move correctly, and train the body to apply those movements in situations. 

How to move:

In movement, Sifu says there aren’t any styles. There’s only the correct or incorrect usage of the body. We all have two arms and two legs, so how many ways can one really use the body as a weapon? The answer is not that many. 

Therefore, the movements themselves are of secondary importance to the understanding of how movement expresses principles of movement. Also of importance is that all the following principles are to be executed at the same time; they do not stand alone, or are even able to be trained in a standalone manner.  Rather they are simply the way that Sifu attempts to explain how his movements take advantage of everything the body can offer, and simultaneously at that.

1. Movement originates from motion in the hip. 

	Exercise: have one person push against another person’s arms, which are outstretched. One person should push back against the other in different ways: first using just the arm, and then starting with the hip. The person playing the role of the opponent should find it harder to feel and predict the defender’s movement when the 	defender originates movement from the hip. 

	1a. Movement is circular. The more you originate movements from the hip, the more you will see how all movements are circular. 

	Finish the move. This is important, because this is the only way to really move an opponent. Making this happen is a mental exercise above all. 

	Exercise: 1 inch punch. In doing the 1 inch punch, it is easy to stop the movement at the point of contact, but this is wrong. You must punch through the person, as if the end of the punch were behind them. 

	Exercises: many Hung Gar line kicking and punching line drills. 

	Tip: In many motions, people usually have too much tension in the shoulders, and therefore need to relax the shoulders and keep them relaxed throughout movements. In this way, movement will originate from the hips and the student will be more aware of it. At first, it will feel strange, like there is something pulling down the shoulders, but this will ultimately be a liberating experience and improve the posture. Generally, do not let the shoulders raise themselves in movements. Ways to avoid this are many: visualizing the movement from the elbows, dan tian breathing, mindfulness of the body. 

	1b. Connect movements. That is, certain movements that appear to need a wind up don’t need it. Examples are certain blocks. 
		ex. Simple block across the body. The wrong way is to lift by bending from the elbow and push out. The correct way is to start moving from the hip and then move from the shoulder joint first. The movement is slightly slower but more effective in blocking.
 
2. Go fast. This is because one must train the way one plans to act in the event of a real emergency.  Train one’s reflexes by starting from resting position and do the motion fast, as if it were the real thing. 

	2a. To do this, you have to relax opposing muscle groups. If for example, you want to pull down, it would not make any sense for the muscles that push up to be in a state of contraction. Yet, this is exactly what happens in people’s bodies because of bad habits. 

	Exercise: Stand in bow stance and swing fists downward from above onto someone holding a pad. One should land on the pad and the other fist should be swing behind you as a counter balancing movement. Go fast, the hit will be harder if the opposing muscle (traps in this case) are relaxed.

	Exercise: Have a partner grab your wrist. Before you try to push or pull away, tense all the muscles in you forearms. Then try the same exercise but relax all the muscles in your forearm. In the tensing the forearm muscles, you should see how tensing muscles hinder movement.

	2b. Do not tense muscles until the final moment of impact….How else can one go fast? By tensing, Sifu uses the analogy of a ball on the string. If you throw the ball and hold the string, the string will be tense when the ball has reached as far as it can go. It that sense the muscles will be “tense” when the movement is in the fullest extension. But then, the string will relax a moment later, and so should the muscles. 

	Exercise: 10 hands and similar movements. 

3. Counter balance all movements. Every movement must have a counter balancing force, and each movement may actually be many movements coordinated together. This is required if the movement is to originate from the hip. 

	Exercise: Pull to punch. Stand in a horse stance and punch someone holding the pad. The punch will be stronger if the puncher thinks about pulling in the outstretched hand rather than punching with the extending hand.

	Exercise: Perform a downward swinging punch over the top of one’s head. Perform it with one hand, and then do it while doing the same movement with the other and in the opposite direction. The punch with the counter balancing movement will be harder. This principle can be experienced with many movements. 

	3a, Settle the body. In all movements, settling the body serves as a form of counter balancing. 

	Exercise: An attacker attempts to tackle you, go into the attacker with a horse stance, and settle the body by spreading the knees slightly in the outward directions. 

	Exercises: Stance Training. Horse stance exercises: push against each other while in the horse stance. The force should go down into the legs, and if a person suddenly releases their hands, the other person should not fall over. 
	
	3c. Counter balance applies also to feet as much as it applies to the hands. In kicking and Punching, these movements have as much of a force pushing into the ground as there is a force from the fist. So not only is there a counter balance in rotational force, but there is counter balance in straight forward force, and actually this counterbalance with the legs is more important.

	Exercises: In moving from a horse to bow-arrow, kicking and punching, attend to the initating movement, that is: the movement from the feet as the origination of the movement. Have a partner measure the force, and it will be better. This exercise may feel unusual because the movement will feel effortless, especially if one is accustomed to punching by tensing one's upper body muscles and not focusing on the lower body. This is an example where the body has become so used to a movement that correcting it is hard because of the ingrained physical habits overcome the feeling of ease. It is also exacerbated by not believing that movement could feel so natural.   
	
4. Use rotation. Do it only at the end of movements to gain an extra force on the opponent.

	Exercise: 10 Hands 

	4a, Meet one force with two forces. In other words: another use of rotation is to counter a force. In blocking, we talk about rotation, but the point of the rotation in the block is not speed but to add another angle to the force. To do this: DO NOT rotate until you make contact with the opponent. 

	Exercise: Have a partner push into you, against your forearms. Resist first just by countering the force, then add rotation of the arms into the resistance. If done correctly, the rotation will move the attacker. 

	4b. Meet a straight line with circle and a circle with a straight line. 

	Exercise: Have an attacker perform a hook punch, block the hook by simply quickly raising the arm up vertically so that the arm moves perpendicularly to the hook. It will stop the hook.

5. When coming up with movements to train, imagine applying the principles of fighting: Spit/Swallow, Sink/Rise, hard/soft, push/pull

	There are many forms that Sifu teaches, but what he has said many times is that he doesn’t remember the movements but rather that he remembers the application of the movement. Therefore, come up with movements by imaging situations and train the defenses.

	5a. A key principle in training movements is to always be applying the bik. Many movements will look right when performed but will still be wrong in subtle ways because they don’t maintain contact or pressure on the opponent. The solution to this is to test the movement with a partner.

		exercise. Chain punch and accompanying footwork, elbow set, footwork in general.  In the chain punch, it is important to apply the punch until the arrival of the next punch. In this way, pressure is maintained. There is a way for the body to do this correctly. 
		exercise. Downward block. The wrong way is to block down, the right way is to block down and out, as toward the opponent. Intuitively, it this makes sense, as a block outward will attack the center, but in practice, students won’t practice the movement with the outward motion. 

6. Punch from the same side of the body, pull from the opposite side of the body.

	Exercise: Have a partner hold a pad. Punch the pad with one’s weight completely on the same side as the punching hand, and then punch with one’s weight on the opposite side - that is, put your body weight entirely on one leg, and then the other. Repeat for pulling the pad. You will find that the above rule holds true. 

7. Connect Movements
	
	Connecting is something very hard to do, but when it’s done, it is quite clear extremely beautiful to watch and one of the most effective techniques in fighting. In nutshell, to connect movements means to not have to reset one’s body before between moves. The challenge in this is that it is tempting to jump prematurely from one movement to the next one in one’s attempt to connect moves. Instead, one must finish a move before commencing the next one. One way to do this is to be aware of the contact point with each movement. 


Ways to Develop the Body.
	1)	Practice Chi Sao to develop sensitivity. [needs an explanation]
	2)	Practice as if there was somebody in front of you, and imagine that person is better than you. This is much easier said than done, but can solve a lot of subtle issues with movement. 
	3)	In doing drills, watch the hand. This can be hard but it trains the mind’s intention and coordination of the body.
	4)	When training with others, use soft focus.
	5)	When training with others tell the person what you need from them to help you train and respect their wishes too.
	6)	Perform movements in their largest ranges of motion, in this way, a realistic situation will not induce a choked movement.   
	⁃	Example: Have a partner stand in front of you and clasp your neck with both hands, as if to choke you. To break their grasp, raise one hand all the way up into the air, as if reaching for the sky, clamp their hand and wrist between your shoulder muscles and neck in doing so, and then turn into them with the hips. This will only work if you raise you hand all the way up. If you raise the arm only halfway, there will be no leverage.  
	7)	Only think of breathing out because you will naturally breathe in, but not the other way around.


How to apply movement in defense:

“My defense is my attack, and my attack is my defense.”

Sifu says, “Of most importance is to manage the force.” This means the defender has to take control of the situation. The defender shouldn’t retreat, but instead should let the force enter into one’s vicinity and then control it. The way to be comfortable with force entering into one’s personal space is to know exactly from where the force will come, and the way to know from whence the force will come is to keep one’s hands by one’s sides and face the opponent. Through this, the opponent will naturally attack the front the body (the “center”), and thus it will be easy to know where the opponent will make an attack. 

In this way, defending oneself against the first attack becomes a matter of timing and correct movement rather than of knowing where the opponent will attack. In fact, there is no way to predict the opponent because they will try to surprise, and people are generally unpredictable. Therefore, do not learn how to defend against certain moves. Learn instead to simply protect the “center” (the space in front your body).

Sifu says, “Protect the center by attacking their center.” That is, every movement must attack the opponent’s center. Do not block the arm, but rather stop the body. When attacking the body, do not simply stop the body, but penetrate the body, and penetrate through the body with speed and correct body structure (see principles of movement above). Attack the opponent’s body in such a way that they lose their intention, and think “Oh shit, what just happened?” This is called bik.

Once you apply the bik, you have very narrow window of opportunity to dominate your opponent. Do not miss out on that opportunity.  Go into them, and do not hit in the same place more than 2 times. Remember that the goal is to make them unable to attack you. This is achieved by making it so that they are unable to make sense of the situation. That is, the only thought in their head should be, “Oh shit, what just happened?” At point, what you do depends on how badly you want to hurt your opponent.

Remember that one hit will do nothing to an opponent. You must attack the opponent with many hits.  Movements flow into one another through the principles of counter balancing. For example, if the defender hits with the right hand, it may be natural to then follow with the the left hand.

Many forms. 

The Stances 

There is a way to perform each stance such that maximum utility is gained, by which we mean a degree of being unable to be pushed over by a force. To achieve this, one might naturally test their stance with a partner, but in order to fix their stance if they fail, here are a few notes.

Horse: Open the knees.

Bow and Arrow: back leg straight, front knee 90 degree. Twist the hips

For the horse and knee, there is also required some ability to let the opposing muscle group relax. In the horse stance, this is the hamstrings. Note that the hamstrings oppose the muscles doing the real work (the quads and butt), so by squeezing the hamstrings, you create unneeded tension by muscles working against one another, and this reduces the strength of the stance because muscles are now “locked” instead of agile. 

In all of the stances, it is important to have good posture, shoulders down and fists at the waist. The chest will be opened very well. 

Cat. 

Cross Step: all the weight on the leg, supporting leg should be parallel with the ground if possible.
